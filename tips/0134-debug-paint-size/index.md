The Flutter widget inspector has a toggle that will help you see the boundaries for each widget in your app.

Want more fine-grained control and enable debug paint only for a specific widget subtree?

Then, you can use this great little package by [@devangelslondon](https://twitter.com/devangelslondon) and debug like a pro:
