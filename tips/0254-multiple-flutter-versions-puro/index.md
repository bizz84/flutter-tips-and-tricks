# Use Multiple Flutter Versions with Puro

Did you know?

Puro is a powerful tool that lets you install multiple versions of Flutter and easily switch between them in your projects.

It's very fast and can automatically configure your IDE to use your desired Flutter version.

<!--

Example commands:

Before Puro, I was using FVM.

But after trying it, I have converted:
- Faster downloads
- Better IDE integration
- Nicer CLI interface
