Sometimes we need to write business logic inside classes that have multiple dependencies.

To do this, we can pass the dependencies as constructor arguments.

A much simpler solution is to pass `ref.read` as an argument.

Here's a thread with all the details. 🧵

---

Reader is just a function we can use to read a provider's value, *just once*.

And once we get the underlying value (a repository in this case), we can call methods on it.

Note: when we want to access a provider inside a widget callback, we do exactly the same thing.

---

An alternative way of doing this is to pass "ref" directly.

As a result, we have to call "ref.read(provider).someMethod()" inside our class methods.

Though if you only ever need to read (and not watch or listen), using Reader makes your intention more explicit.

---

But how to you write unit tests for classes using Reader (or Ref)?

Glad you asked!

I'll be covering that in a separate thread (and article) soon. 👍
